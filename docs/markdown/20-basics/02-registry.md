# Docker registry

> A Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for named Docker images. The same image might have multiple different versions, identified by their tags.

- Images Stored in it
- Public registry eg. [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=)
- Private registry eg. [JFROG ARTIFACTORY](https://jfrog.com/fr/artifactory/), [Google Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry)

Notes: 

* programming metaphor: if an image is a class, then a container is an instance of a class
* Images can exist without containers
* container needs to run an image to exist
