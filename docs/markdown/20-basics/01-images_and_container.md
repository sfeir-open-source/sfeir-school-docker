## Images

- Immutable
- Stored in a Docker registry
- Composed of layers of other images

##--##

## Container

- An instance of an image
- Isolated place where an application runs without affecting the rest of the system

Notes: 

* programming metaphor: if an image is a class, then a container is an instance of a class
* Images can exist without containers
* container needs to run an image to exist
